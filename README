# MIPS CODE

MIPS-Code is sample translations I've done from C to MIPS

## Usage
I wrote the MIPS code using Mars4_5.
To run any of the sample MIPS code on Mars:
-Download Mars (https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/download.htm)
-Open desired MIPS file (.asm) [File -> Open]
-Run -> Assemble  , Run -> Go
